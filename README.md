1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.

I would definitely use unit tests to test the 'messaging feature'. A crucial test would be probably to ensure that the text that is being sent is identical and the same to the text that is being received, I believe.

2) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.

We can definitely use unit testing to test out the 'max message length feature'! There are many such parameters that we can explicitly test for, such as for cases with message lengths of 0, more than 0 and less than 80, exactly 80, and additionally greater than 80 characters, I believe.
